# anomaly
a simple p2p file/media sharing program

---

when sharing files and media with other users, you will be given the option of an http, ftp, sftp, scp, or rsync link, depending on what your platform supports and what you have installed (you will have to supply your own ssl certificate)

### in future:
there will be a way to send messages to other clients even if they are offline/have no way to receive the message

optional encryption of some kind, it will start off very basic, but as i learn more about encryption it will get better and cover more
