  execute the [build script](build) like so `./build windows` or `./build linux`

windows:
  the command listed below may not be as up to date as the one in the build script, if you have issues please refer to the build script
  `cargo build --features=windows-native --release --target=x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`

apple:
  both m1/2 and x86 versions will not be developed for as i do not have access to apple hardware

  however, i will accept pull requests for adding support to apple hardware, just know it will not have explicit support from me
