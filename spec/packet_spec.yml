# version  size   multi packet count  type  packet body

version: packet version, allows backward compatibility later down the line, or at the very least basic communication to let either the server or client know its potentially outdated and needs to terminate the connection in case the changes will result in improper data transport

size: size of packet body

multi packet count: how many *extra* packets to read after this one

type:
  common:
    36: multi packet
  client:
    19: auth request
  server:
    29: response, 0 success, any other value fail (F for custom error response in ascii?)
    32: session token


constant behavior:
  
  server relay status every 5 secs while waiting in queue
  once spot available, update client immediately and init connection
  
  client if relay misses target say disconnect and relay to server queue disconnect status
