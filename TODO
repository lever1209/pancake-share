offline messaging if no one is able to receive the message
	will depend on optional remotes you can add to relay messages if the others go online while you are offline
	contacts can act as remotes
	no relays will relay files by default

optional key based encryption
	it will be disabled by default, and users will be warned about this
	after i get mostly positive feedback about the encryption implementation it will be enabled as default in all subsequent builds
